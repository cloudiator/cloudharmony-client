To improve performance, a CDN attempts to fulfill each request using an edge server that is physically or topologically close to the user it originates from. This property refers to the methods used by the CDN to make this determination. We independently analyze each CDN to determine the methods used. A CDN may employ multiple methods. The following are supported:<ul><li><em>Edge Anycast</em> allows a CDN to share a single IP address on multiple edge servers and automatically route users to the server that is topologically closest. When properly configured, Anycast edge routing provides many advantages over DNS including consistent optimal edge server selection, improved reliability due to quicker failover, and elimination of DNS dependencies. However, due to the cost and complexity of properly setting up and maintaining Anycast networks, is a less common method. Additionally, Anycast routing is often less reliable in less established Internet regions including Asia and South America.</li><li><em>DNS</em>: The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves a textual hostname like www.google.com to a unique numeric address required by computers to communicate. A CDN may use DNS to route user requests to nearby edge servers by resolving your CDN hostname (e.g. cdn.mydomain.com) differently depending on where the user is located. This is the most common method for CDN edge routing because it is relatively easy to setup and administer. However, exclusive use of DNS edge routing can be prone to accuracy, reliability and performance issues. DNS edge routing relies on use of a Geo IP database to correlate IP addresses to geographical location, and these databases are often inaccurate. Additionally, the IP address the CDN sees for a DNS query is that of an intermediary DNS resolver (often belonging to the user's ISP) and not that of the user. The location of the user's DNS resolver - the basis by which edge routing decisions are made - may not be the same as the user. This discrepency can result in the user being routed to a more distant edge server. Reliability issues can also arise due to DNS caching. If a CDN edge server is taken out of service, users with cached DNS may continue to attempt to connect to it. To minimize DNS caching problems, a CDN may set low DNS cache times (e.g. 30 secs - 1 min as opposed to typical 1 hour+). However, doing so will require users to query DNS more frequently which can impact performance.</li><li><em>EDNS</em> is an extension to the Domain Name System that allows intermediary DNS resolvers to include the user's IP address when submitting DNS queries. If supported, the CDN may use this information to determine the user's location (as opposed to that of the DNS resolver) in order to more accurately choose the closest CDN edge server. Because EDNS is new, support is still limited, but the largest public DNS services - Google Public DNS and OpenDNS - now support it.</li><li><em>Proprietary</em>: Some CDN services use proprietary methods for edge server routing. These are often used in conjunction with standard DNS routing.</li><li><em>Anycast DNS</em>: The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves a textual hostname like www.google.com to a unique numeric address required by computers to communicate. Anycast routing allows multiple servers to share a single IP address and automatically route users to the server that is topologically closest. Use of Anycast DNS means resolving your CDN hostname (e.g. cdn.mydomain.com) to an edge server IP address will be generally fast and reliable. Anycast DNS is fairly ubiquitous for CDNs, only minimally improves performance, and should not be confused with the much less common use of edge Anycast which impacts performance more significantly.</li></ul>",
